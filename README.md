# Chapter 4 Lab - Task 2: Token-based Session Management

In Task 1, we have discussed the problem of authenticating users each time they want to see their posts. In Task 2, we have solved such a problem using session-based session management.
In this task, we will get a demonstration of another way to handle users’ session and that is using Json Web Tokens (or JWT).

## Project Preparation

1. Clone or download the code from the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/houcine1amraoui/lab3-task3-token-based-session-management-demo
2. Open the project folder with VS Code.
3. Open the integrated terminal and run “npm install” command to install the dependencies.
4. Run “npm run start” command to run the server.

## Questions

1. Use postman to login with the user “amina-msila”.
2. Now, display the posts created by the user “amina-msila”. Explain the whole process.
